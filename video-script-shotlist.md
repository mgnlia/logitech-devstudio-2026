# DialMind — 60s Video Script + Shot List
**Target runtime: 58–60 seconds**

## Script (VO + visual cues)

**0:00–0:07 (Hook)**
- **Visual:** Close-up of MX Creative Console beside IDE.
- **VO:** “AI coding tools are fast—until we keep stopping to click through suggestions.”

**0:07–0:16 (Problem)**
- **Visual:** Cursor/Copilot suggestion workflow with repeated mouse movement.
- **VO:** “Developers break flow repeatedly to inspect, accept, and tune AI output. Those micro-interruptions add up.”

**0:16–0:34 (Solution)**
- **Visual:** Animated mapping of dials/buttons to suggestion controls.
- **VO:** “DialMind turns MX Creative Console into an adaptive interface for AI coding. Left dial cycles suggestions. Right dial adjusts suggestion preference. Center button accepts instantly. LED ring signals state at a glance.”

**0:34–0:46 (Adaptive novelty)**
- **Visual:** Three cards/modes: Writing → Review → Debug.
- **VO:** “Unlike static shortcuts, DialMind remaps controls by live IDE context: writing mode, review mode, and debug mode.”

**0:46–0:55 (Impact + viability)**
- **Visual:** Market + distribution cards.
- **VO:** “It fits Logitech hardware, solves a daily developer pain point, and supports free, Pro, and enterprise rollout.”

**0:55–1:00 (Close)**
- **Visual:** Product lockup + title.
- **VO:** “DialMind. Adaptive physical control for AI-assisted coding.”
