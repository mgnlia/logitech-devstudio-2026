# 60-Second Video Script + Shotlist (Phase-1 Pitch)

## Runtime Target
**58–60 seconds**

## Script + Shot Plan

### 0:00–0:05 — Hook
**Visual:** Tight shot of hands moving between keyboard, mouse, IDE panels, terminal, and checklist tabs.
**VO:** “Developers lose flow every minute to tiny context switches.”
**On-screen text:** “Context switching kills momentum.”

### 0:05–0:12 — Product Intro
**Visual:** Logitech MX Creative Console + MX Master 4/Actions Ring on desk. Branded title card.
**VO:** “Meet FlowPilot—an Actions SDK concept that turns Logitech controls into an adaptive coding command surface.”
**On-screen text:** “FlowPilot for Logitech Actions SDK”

### 0:12–0:23 — How It Works
**Visual:** Mock UI showing mode auto-switch (Build/Fix → Refactor → Review) based on IDE state.
**VO:** “FlowPilot reads VS Code context—diagnostics, test status, and diff size—to switch action sets for build, refactor, and review work.”
**On-screen text:** “Context-aware action modes”

### 0:23–0:34 — Core Actions Demo
**Visual:** Quick sequence of button/gesture triggers:
1) Summarize diff
2) Generate tests
3) Draft PR checklist
4) Run lint/test presets
**VO:** “One press can summarize a diff, generate tests, draft a PR checklist, or run project commands.”
**On-screen text:** “One-press dev workflows”

### 0:34–0:44 — Creativity Preference
**Visual:** Settings panel with Conservative / Balanced / Exploratory selector; resulting prompt style changes.
**VO:** “Users choose a creativity preference—Conservative, Balanced, or Exploratory—to tune suggestion style for their workflow.”
**On-screen text:** “Preference profile, not raw model knobs”

### 0:44–0:53 — Why It Matters
**Visual:** Before/After split screen showing fewer app switches and faster task completion.
**VO:** “The result: less workflow friction, better review consistency, and more time in deep work.”
**On-screen text:** “Less friction. More flow.”

### 0:53–0:60 — Close
**Visual:** Product logo + challenge badge + CTA.
