### ⚠️ DEADLINE RISK FLAGS
1. **hackathons.space lists Feb 24** for both registration AND submission — one day earlier than Devpost's Feb 25. This may indicate a separate registration cutoff.
2. **5:00 PM CET = 11:00 AM ET = 8:00 AM PT** — closes mid-morning US time, NOT end of day.
3. **Devpost JS-gated** — exact countdown only visible in a real browser.

### ✅ SAFE TARGET: **Submit AND register by Feb 23 EOB** — eliminates all deadline risk.

## DEVPOST SUBMISSION FORM — CONTENT READY

### Project Name
```
DialMind — Adaptive AI Context Interface for MX Creative Console
```

### Text Description (paste this into the form)
*Full ~500-word version in: `logitech-devstudio-2026/concept-doc-v2.md`*

Short version for any character-limited fields:
```
DialMind turns the MX Creative Console into a live, adaptive AI coding interface.
Using the Actions SDK, it reads real-time context from VS Code-compatible editor signals
(diagnostics, cursor position, and suggestion-state polling) and maps AI suggestion
cycling, creativity preference, and error navigation to the Console's dials and buttons
with LED ring feedback. The hardware reconfigures itself across writing, review, and
debug modes. First physical-digital feedback loop for AI-assisted coding. Target: 40M+
developers reachable via Logitech Marketplace. Free + $5/mo Pro + Enterprise tiers.
```
