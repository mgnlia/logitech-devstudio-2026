## Script with timing

### 0:00–0:07 — Hook
**Visual:** Close-up of MX Creative Console, then IDE with AI suggestions visible.

**VO:**
"AI coding assistants help us write faster—but interacting with them still interrupts flow."

### 0:07–0:16 — Problem
**Visual:** Developer repeatedly leaving keyboard flow to mouse through suggestions and error panels.

**VO:**
"Developers constantly context-switch: inspect suggestions, accept, reject, jump to errors—again and again."

### 0:16–0:35 — Solution
**Visual:** Overlay labels on Console controls + IDE side-by-side.

**VO:**
"DialMind connects the MX Creative Console directly to AI coding workflow. Left dial cycles suggestions. Right dial adjusts suggestion preference from conservative to exploratory. Center button accepts instantly."

### 0:35–0:46 — Adaptive novelty
**Visual:** Mode cards animate: Writing → Review → Debug; control mappings change in each mode.

**VO:**
"And it adapts. As IDE context changes, DialMind remaps controls for writing, review, and debugging—so the hardware matches your cognitive mode in real time."

### 0:46–0:55 — Impact
**Visual:** Stat cards + “Logitech Marketplace” card.

**VO:**
"This brings a physical interface to everyday AI-assisted development—reducing friction and preserving deep focus for a massive developer audience."

### 0:55–1:00 — Close
**Visual:** Product lockup/title card.

**VO:**
"DialMind. Built for Logitech DevStudio. The MX Creative Console as your AI coding copilot."
