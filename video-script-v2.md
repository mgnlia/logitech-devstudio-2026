## SCRIPT (with timecodes)

---

**[0:00–0:08] — THE HOOK**
*[SHOT: Close-up of MX Creative Console dials, idle. Cut to developer's screen — Cursor IDE open, AI suggestion panel visible.]*

> **VO:** "You're in flow. The AI just finished a suggestion. And now you have to stop, move your mouse, and click to see it."

---

**[0:08–0:18] — THE PROBLEM**
*[SHOT: Screen recording — developer repeatedly mousing over to accept Copilot suggestions, breaking keyboard rhythm. Simple animation showing "flow interrupted" counter ticking up.]*

> **VO:** "Developers using Cursor, Copilot, or Claude break their keyboard flow dozens of times an hour — just to interact with the AI that's supposed to make them faster."

---

**[0:18–0:38] — THE SOLUTION**
*[SHOT: MX Creative Console on desk. Hand rests on left dial. Screen shows Cursor IDE. Diagram overlay appears showing dial → suggestion cycle mapping.]*

> **VO:** "DialMind connects the MX Creative Console directly to your AI coding workflow."

*[SHOT: Animated diagram — left dial cycles suggestions, right dial adjusts suggestion preference with color gradient, center button accepts, LED ring pulses blue when suggestion is ready.]*

> **VO:** "Left dial: cycle suggestions. Right dial: dial in suggestion preference — conservative to exploratory. Center button: accept. The LED ring tells you when the AI is ready — without looking away from your code."

*[SHOT: Diagram showing adaptive mode switching — writing mode → review mode → debug mode, with dial functions changing.]*

> **VO:** "And it's adaptive. DialMind reads your IDE context and reconfigures the dials automatically — writing mode, review mode, debug mode. The hardware surface changes with you."

---

**[0:38–0:50] — THE SCALE**
*[SHOT: Simple stat cards animating in: "1M+ Cursor users" / "1.3M+ Copilot subscribers" / "40M+ devices, Logitech Marketplace"]*

> **VO:** "One plugin. Forty million potential users. Every developer already using AI tools — now with a physical interface that keeps them in flow."

---

**[0:50–0:58] — THE CLOSE**
*[SHOT: MX Creative Console + Cursor IDE side by side. DialMind logo appears.]*

> **VO:** "DialMind. Built with the Logitech Actions SDK. The MX Creative Console, reimagined as your AI co-pilot."

---

**[0:58–1:00] — TITLE CARD**
*[SHOT: Static card — "DialMind | Logitech DevStudio 2026 | Actions SDK Track"]*

*(No voiceover — let it breathe.)*

| 4 | Dial mapping diagram (left/right/center labels) | Figma / Keynote slide | 8s |
| 5 | LED ring color states (blue/amber/red) | Figma / simple animation | 6s |
| 6 | Adaptive mode switching diagram | Figma / Keynote slide | 8s |
| 7 | Stat cards (1M+ / 1.3M+ / 40M+) | Keynote / Canva | 8s |
| 8 | Console + IDE side-by-side | Composite / screenshot | 5s |
| 9 | Title card | Keynote / Canva | 3s |

**Total:** ~56s of visuals + 2s buffer = 58s ✅

## PRODUCTION NOTES

- **No prototype needed.** Diagrams + screen recording of existing IDE is sufficient for Phase 1.
- **Voiceover:** Record in one take if possible. Aim for 140–150 words per minute (conversational pace). Script above is ~130 words = ~52 seconds spoken.
- **Music:** Optional, keep low. Avoid anything with copyright. Use YouTube Audio Library or Pixabay.
- **Captions:** Add if possible — judges may watch muted.
- **File:** Export at 1080p minimum. Upload to YouTube as unlisted. Copy the share URL.
